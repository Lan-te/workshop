    <h1>LANTANA'S PERSONAL STRUGGLE</h1>

    for three days now, i've been writing some HTML code, and it's being an 
    interesting journey.i've learned a lot, challenged my self to learn new 
    things, and i was supposed to host a website. However, that was a difficult
    task, so i had sought assistane from my friend Asantewaa, and it was fun.

    <h2>MY JOURNEY WITH FREECODECAMP</h2>
    Freecodecamp has become one of the platforms I use in my Computer

    This platform is a web developing platform which helps students 
    or individuals who are interested in Web Development. Freecodecamp was
     introduced to me by a lecturer who is taking me in L200 .
